        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">How to reduce my chances of getting sick while I travel?</h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          Avoid close contact by staying at least six feet away from anyone who is not in your household.
          <br>Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered while in public settings.
          <br>Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer.
          <br>Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.
          <br> Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
          <br>Do not travel with someone who is sick.
          <br>Follow state and local recommendations or requirements after you return from travel.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">Should I wear a mask?</h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          CDC recommends that everyone wear a mask over their nose and mouth when in public, including on public
          transportation and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Masks slow the spread of COVID-19
          because they help keep people who are infected from spreading respiratory droplets to others when they cough,
          sneeze, or talk. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are for healthcare workers and other first responders, as
          recommended by current CDC guidance.


        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">Can traveling to visit family or friends increase my chances of
          getting and spreading COVID-19?</h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          Yes. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Before you travel, learn if COVID-19 is
          spreading in your local area or in any of the places you are going. Traveling to visit family may be
          especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19. People at higher
          risk for severe illness need to take extra precautions.


        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">How can I protect myself if I go out? </h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          Staying home is still safest, but if you go out, stay at least six feet away from others, wear a face covering
          and wash your hands frequently. Stay close to home to avoid spreading COVID-19 across county lines.


        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">Should I cancel my vacation plans? </h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          Non-essential travel is discouraged. If you do travel, stay 6 feet from others and wear a cloth face covering.
          Be sure to check the status and conditions of the location youâ€™re traveling to. Visit our page for current
          guidance.


        </p>


        <h3 style="font-weight:bold" class="px-3">Should I wear a homemade cloth face mask? </h3>
        <p class="px-3">
          A homemade cloth face covering can be an effective and affordable option. Easy alternatives are to use a scarf
          or any breathable, washable fabric and wrap it around your face so that a couple layers of fabric are
          completely covering your mouth and nose.
        </p>
